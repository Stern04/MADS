This Report was done for the first Milestone course in the MADS program. We were free to pick a subject and data of our choosing with one partner. The final product was not articulated until after we had done our original phase of data exploration and manipulation. We ended up exploring and visualizing COVID-19 data alongside energy generation rates from the EIA as well as looking more generally how energy efficiency works by considering new metrics such as MOER (Marginal Operating emissions Rates). 

The PDF generated from the Jupyter Notebook in this folder was the working notebook I used for the Cartogram creation, and as such it has not been manicured for presentation. The Cartogram (see Cartograms folder) is from the portion of the report that explores the U.S. COVID-19 cases per 100k population compared to average net energy generation. Cartograms were created from March-July 2020 as the EIA did not have more recent data in September 2020 when the project was underway. There is also a simple .webmd version of the cartogram that crudely animates the differences between the time series. 

The criteria given for this project was that there must be a significant amount of data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization etc. from at least two or more sources.This included heavy use of Pandas, Geopandas, Plotly and Numpy just to name a few. While the project received a perfect grade and provoked some interesting thought, I have intentions to return to this visualization method but to find data at the daily level and further interpolate between each daily interval which would result in a very smooth Cartogram animation.
