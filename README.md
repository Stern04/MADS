Master of Applied Data Science at The University of Michigan

This repository is showcasing some of the work that I have completed in my Masters in Applied Data Science at the University of Michigan.
Currently, I am only highlighting some of my higher level data visualizations. 


These three visualizations all come from the report in the Energy and Covid-19 Project directory. They all required rigorous data cleaning
and merging before visualizing, and this is most true for the visualization showing Energy Generation vs Covid-19 rates. More can be found 
in the Read_me in said directory.
